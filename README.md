# Missile-Command
Missile Command is one of the classic video games of the early 1980s, along with Pacman, Donkey Kong, Frogger, and Space Invaders, amongst others. 
In contrast to most other games of the time, you used a trackball to target enemy missiles that were threating to annihilate you and your planet.  
The only thing standing between your planet and total destruction is your skill and dedication.
